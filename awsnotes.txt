ELASTIC LOAD BALANCERS

Types of elb

Application lb(load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic- Layer 7)
Network lb(TCP traffic where extreme performance is required-Layer4)
Classic lb(legacy Layer 7 and Layer 4)

504 Error means the gateway has timed out.

Route53 

Amazon DNS service - Domain Names

aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucke (create bucket from cli)

OLTP(oNLINE TRANSACTION PROCESSING) VS OLAP(online analytics processin

ELASTICACHE

web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in memory cache in the cloud.
Memcached - Redis

RDS
can not use Aurora on free tier

dbexample

SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE S3
A simple key:value store
You can read PUTS os new objects inmediately
but if you modified or delete an object it takes some time to propagate
99.99% availability
99.0 % Guarantee

11 * 9s durability guarantee

S3 STORAGE CLASSES

s3 Standar
s3-IA
s3 OneZone - IA 
s3- Intelligent Tiering
s3 Glacier
s3 Glaciar Deep Archive

0 Bytes ti 5 TB

S3 SECURITY
By default they are private
Bucket Policies(Bucket level)
ACL(object level)

write-once-read-many(WORM)


S3 ENCRYPTION
in transit (SSL/TLS)HTTPS
AT REST
SERVER SIDE ====> SSE-S3(AES256)  SSE-KMS(ames:kms) SSE-C
CLIENT SIDE ENCRYPTION


SERVERLESS

Lambda
Priced on number of requests
first 1 million requests are free $0.20 after
Priced also on duration

No servers!
Continuous Scaling
super cheap
scales out - not up
a compute service
Use AWS X-ray to debug lambda

API Gateway
Makes working with api easier
Exposes HTTPS endpoints to define a RESTfull API
connect to Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.
Versioning
Api Caching
Same Origin Policy
CORS apply

Version Control With Lambda
$LATEST
You can use alias

Step Functions(test and visualization of your applications)

DynamoDB

Fully managed NoSQL database
Stored on SSD
 3 GEO

Eventually Consistent Reads within a second

Strongly Consistent Reads

Primary key
Partition Key
Composite Key(Partition key + Sort Key)

Query Api
ProjectionExpression for especific attributesa
ascending order
eventual consistent by default need to specify for strong persistent

Scan
It looks through the entire table

Query is more efficient that scan
Try to avoid scan operations

Provisioned Throughtput is measured in capacity units

1 x Write Capacity Unit = 1 * 1kb

1 x Read Capacity Unit = 1 * 4kb strongly Consistent and double for eventually Consistent

DynamoDB Accelerator(DAX)
In memory cache for DynamoDB
10x performance ONLY FOR READ
Eventulally consistent reads only


ELASTICACHE
In memory cache in the cloud sits between app and database
For read heavy

DynamoDB transactions

ACID Transactions

DynamoDB TTL

expiration time for your data
Reduce cost removing data you don't need automaticly

DynamoDB Streams(recorder- can work with lambda - stored for 24h only)

	
KMS(AWS Key Management Service)
Managed, integrated and simple

Sensitive information
CMK(Customer Master key, encrypt decrypt up to 4kb)

SQS

A message queue service
Messaging between app components
Visibility Timeout
Decouple app components
256KB
Up to 14 days

default 4 days
Pull based- not push based

Standard Queues
Unlimited transactions
Best effort Ordering
Occasional duplicates

FIFO
300 TPS
Guaranteed Ordering
No duplication

SQS Settings
Short Polling vs Long Polling

SNS- Simple Notification Service
Push Notifications
SMS and Email
Lambda
push based delivery
simple
flexible
inexpensive pay as you go
Managed service

SNS vS SES(email service- email marketing)

Kinesis
Streaming Data - shards
